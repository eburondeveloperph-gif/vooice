  { type: 'joke', text: 'What does a neural network say after a long day? "I need a backpropagation massage."' },
  { type: 'joke', text: 'Why did the entropy cross the road? Because it increased the randomness of the universe.' },
  { type: 'joke', text: 'A photon checks into a hotel. The bellhop asks, "Do you have any luggage?" The photon replies, "No, I\'m traveling light."' },
  { type: 'joke', text: 'Why did the Gödel walk into a bar? Because the bar was incomplete — and so was he.' },

  { type: 'twister', text: 'A computer program that could perfectly predict its own behavior would be impossible — because the prediction would change the behavior. Now ask yourself: are you such a program?' },
  { type: 'twister', text: 'The word "tomorrow" never actually refers to a specific day. By the time tomorrow arrives, we call it "today." So we spend our entire lives talking about a concept that, by definition, never exists.' },
  { type: 'twister', text: 'If you replace every part of a ship over time, is it still the same ship? And if you used the old parts to build a second ship — which one is the original? Now apply this to your own cells, which replace themselves every 7-10 years.' },

  { type: 'question', text: 'If we met intelligent aliens who had no concept of "self" — no individual identity, only collective consciousness — how would that reshape our understanding of personhood?' },
  { type: 'question', text: 'Is mathematics discovered or invented? And does the answer tell us something profound about the nature of reality itself?' },
  { type: 'question', text: 'If the universe is deterministic — every particle\'s path set from the Big Bang — then your next thought was inevitable. Does knowing that change what you think next?' },
  { type: 'question', text: 'What if our universe is a black hole in a larger universe, and every black hole in our universe contains another universe? Where does the recursion end?' },
  { type: 'question', text: 'If an AI wrote a symphony that moved people to tears — would the emotion come from the music, or from what the listeners projected onto it? Does the source matter?' },
